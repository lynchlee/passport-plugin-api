# Passport Plugin API ![semver 2.0.0 compliant](http://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

This project provides the APIs and SPIs that are used to write Passport plugins.

Currently, there is a single plugin SPI for Passport that allows customers to support different password encryption schemes. This interface is `com.inversoft.passport.plugin.spi.security.PasswordEncryptor`.
